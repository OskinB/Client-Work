# 💼 Client Work

A few years ago, I had the opportunity to work with several clients to design and build custom websites tailored to their goals and audiences. Once the direction was clear, I handled both the design and development, ensuring the final product was responsive, user-friendly, and aligned with their brand identity.<br/>
When the work was complete and the clients were happy with the results, I handed over the finished websites, providing them with all the tools they needed to manage their content going forward.
